# VersaHeadHunter
WoWProgress parser and Discord announcer using bot for player recruitment

# How it works
The tracker polls the precombined URL (check Program.cs for configurable static variables) from WoWProgress.com every 15 minutes and parses it. As new player appears there it will be queued to discord bot to post its data (role, spec, note, progress, etc.) into specific channel.
